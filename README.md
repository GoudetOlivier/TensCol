# TensCol
Source code for the article "Population-based Gradient Descent Weight Learning for Graph Coloring Problems".
Applications to standard Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) and Equitable graph Coloring Problem (ECP).

In order to use TensCol you need Python and Pytorch. 
We highly recommand to use GPUs if possible. 
If you have multiple GPU devices available you can run multiple experiments in parallel by changing the variable ngpus.
